Baby Yoda War

Begun these cuteness wars have

Pick which Yoda is the cutest! I set this site up to collect data for my daughter's science project to scientifically measure cuteness based on variables such as eye and mouth size. Do as many "battles" as you like, the more data the better!

About
Used Adobe Photoshop's "Liquify" tool with face detection. Didn't always detect face had to use certain images, probably because designed for human faces. Didn't really find mouth correctly. Features applied symmetrically.

Eye size
Eye height
Eye width
Eye tilt - didn't do
Eye distance
Nose height/width - also affected mouth because of the way face was detected.
No mouth settings because didn't detect mouth correctly.
Forehead
Chin height - not used due to mouth detection issues.
Jawline and face width both used to adjust width of face.
